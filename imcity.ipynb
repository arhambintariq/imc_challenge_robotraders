    "# Some Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python >=3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "requests>=2.32.2\n",
    "\n",
    "sseclient-py>=1.8.0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exchange GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test exchange will be sent out via email to all registered participants (register [here](https://tinyurl.com/IMC-Challenge))\n",
    "- The real exchange will be announced on Saturday morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim of this challenge is to write an automated algorithm to trade\n",
    "- Do not manipulate or interfere with other teams’ bots or the exchange. **Don't try to break things!**\n",
    "- No collusion or coordinated trading between teams\n",
    "- Keep API usage efficient — don’t hammer endpoints (max 1 request/sec, preferably less)\n",
    "- Don’t spawn excessive connections or threads\n",
    "- Hard position limits are applied (±200 long or short position per product)\n",
    "- Be curious, collaborative, and competitive — but keep the system running for everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each product, we normalize your PnL by the sum of all positive PnLs across teams in that product.\n",
    "- This makes each product’s score a percentage share of the achievable positive PnL.\n",
    "- Teams with losses still have negative PnL, which will reduce their total score.\n",
    "- The ETF product counts double — its normalized score is multiplied by 2.\n",
    "- Your final total score is the sum of all product scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional features\n",
    "\n",
    "Sections marked as optional below are features supported by the exchange but not necessarily needed for writing a working arbitrager script. However, you are more than welcome to try it!\n",
